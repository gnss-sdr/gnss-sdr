Global Navigation Satellite Systems receiver defined by software. It performs all the signal 
processing from raw signal samples up to the computation of the Position-Velocity-Time solution, 
including code and phase observables. It is able to work with raw data files or, if there is 
computational power enough, in real time with suitable radiofrequency front-ends. This software 
is mainly developed at [CTTC](http://www.cttc.es "Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya")
with contributions from around the world. More info at [gnss-sdr.org](http://gnss-sdr.org "GNSS-SDR's Homepage").
