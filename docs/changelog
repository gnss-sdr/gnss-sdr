## [Unreleased](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/tree/next)

Next release will have several improvements in different dimensions, addition of new features and bug fixes:

### Improvements in Accuracy:

- Part of the RTKLIB core library has been integrated into GNSS-SDR. There is now a single PVT block implementation which makes use of RTKLIB to deliver PVT solutions, including Single and PPP navigation modes.
- Fixed CN0 estimation for other correlation times than 1 ms.
- Improved computation of tracking parameters and GNSS observables.
- Other minor bug fixes.


### Improvements in Availability:

- Internal Finite State Machines rewritten for improved continuity in delivering position fixes. This fixes a bug that was stalling the receiver after about six hours of continuous operation.
- Redesign of the time counter for enhanced continuity.
- Improved flow graph in multisystem configurations: the receiver does not get stalled anymore if no signal is found from the first system.
- Improved acquisition and tracking sensitivity.
- Other minor bug fixes.


### Improvements in Efficiency:

- Added the possibility of non-blocking acquisition, which works well when using real-time data from an RF front-end.
- Improved flow graph in multiband configurations: satellites acquired in one band are immediately searched in others.
- Complex local codes have been replaced by real codes, alleviating the computational burden.
- New volk_gnsssdr kernels: volk_gnsssdr_16i_xn_resampler_16i_xn.h, volk_gnsssdr_16ic_16i_rotator_dot_prod_16ic_xn.h, volk_gnsssdr_32f_xn_resampler_32f_xn.h, volk_gnsssdr_32fc_32f_rotator_dot_prod_32fc_xn.h
- Some AVX2 implementations added to the volk_gnsssdr library.
- Improvement in C++ usage: Use of const container calls when result is immediately converted to a const iterator. Using these members removes an implicit conversion from iterator to const_iterator.
- A number of code optimizations here and there.


### Improvements in Flexibility:

- A number of new parameters have been exposed to the configuration system.
- Possibility to choose Pilot or Data component for tracking of GPS L5 and Galileo E5a signals.
- Enabled extended coherent integration times.
- Some configuration parameters can now be overridden by commandline flags for easier use in scripts.


### Improvements in Interoperability:

- Added the GPS L5 receiver chain.
- Added the GLONASS L1 SP receiver chain.
- Added the GLONASS L2 SP receiver chain.
- Improvements in the Galileo E5a and GPS L2C receiver chains.
- Updated list of available GNSS satellites.
- Added five more signal sources: "Fmcomms2_Signal_Source" (requires gr-iio), "Plutosdr_Signal Source" (requires gr-iio), "Spir_GSS6450_File_Signal_Source", "Labsat_Signal_Source" and "Custom_UDP_Signal_Source" (requires libpcap). Documented in https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/sp-blocks/signal-source/
- Improved support for BladeRF, HackRF and RTL-SDR front-ends.
- Added tools for the interaction with front-ends based on the AD9361 chipset.
- Intermediate results are now saved in .mat binary format, readable from Matlab/Octave and from Python via h5py.
- Added the GPX output format.
- Fixed a bug in the format of NMEA sentences when latitude or longitude minutes were >10.
- Improvements in the RTCM server stability.
- Improvements in the correctness of generated RINEX files.


### Improvements in Maintainability:

- Setup of a Continuous Integration system that checks building and runs QA code in a wide range of GNU/Linux distributions (ArchLinux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu) and releases. See https://gitlab.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr
- Creation of multi-system processing blocks, drastically reducing code duplication and maintainability time.
- Automated code formatting with clang-format. This tool is widely available and easy to integrate into many code editors, and it also can be used from the command line. It cuts time spent on adhering to the project's code formatting style.
- Improvement in C++ usage: C-style casts have been replaced by C++ casts. C-style casts are difficult to search for. C++ casts provide compile time checking ability and express programmers' intent better, so they are safer and clearer.
- Improvement in C++ usage: The override special identifier is now used when overriding a virtual function. This helps the compiler to check for type changes in the base class, making the detection of errors easier.
- Improvement in C++ usage: A number of unused includes have been removed. Order of includes set to: local (in-source) headers, then library headers, then system headers. This helps to detect missing includes.
- Improvement in C++ usage: Enhanced const correctness. Misuses of those variables are detected by the compiler.


### Improvements in Portability:

- Several CMake scripts improvements, more verbose outputs in case of errors. Building configuration has been documented in https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/tutorials/configuration-options-building-time/
- Improved SDK for cross-compilation in embedded devices. Documented in https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/tutorials/cross-compiling/
- Improved control over minimum required versions for core dependencies.

- Improvement in C++ usage: The <stdio.h> library has been replaced by the more modern and portable <fstream> for file handling.
- Improvement in C++ usage: C++ libraries preferred over C libraries (e.g., <cctype> instead of <ctype.h>, <cmath> instead of <math.h>).
- Fixes required by Debian packaging.
- Fixes required by Macports packaging.
- A downside in portability: BLAS and LAPACK libraries are now required even in ARM devices.
- A downside in portability: the matio library >= 1.5.3 is a new required dependency. If not found, it is downloaded and built automatically at building time, but this requires libtool, automake and hdf5 already installed in the system.


### Improvements in Reliability:

- Introduced 3 new Input Filter implementations for pulsed and narrowband interference mitigation: `Pulse_Blanking_Filter`, `Notch_Filter` and `Notch_Filter_Lite`. Documented in https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/sp-blocks/input-filter/

- The RINEX printer can now print L2C and E5a observables and navigation files, including multiband configurations.
- Added RTCM 3.2 output to more receiver configurations.


### Improvements in Maintainability:

- The VOLK_GNSSSDR library can now be built with Python 3. Switched dependencies for VOLK_GNSSDR: from (old, python2.7-only) python-cheetah templates to Python3 friendly python-mako and python-six. So, Python-cheetah dependency has been dropped, and python-mako and python-six have been added.
- If suitable versions of gflags, glog, armadillo or googletest are not found in the system, they will be downloaded and built at compile time (versions 2.2.0, 0.3.4, 7.600.2 and 1.8.0, respectively).

- Added CMake Python finder and module checker.
- Deleted files related to CPack.
- Fixes, updates and improvements in the documentation.
- Improvements in CMake scripts: General code cleaning and addition of comments. Improved user information in case of failure. Improved detection of dependencies in more processor architectures (e.g. aarch64).


### Improvements in Marketability:

- Reduced time from a commit to deployment (see virtualization mechanisms in Portability).


### Improvements in Portability:

- BLAS and LAPACK libraries are no longer mandatory on ARM devices.


### Improvements in Scalability:

- Fixed bug in acquisition with rata rates higher than 16 Msps in 4ms code periods.


### Improvements in Testability:

- Major QA source code refactoring: they has been split into src/tests/unit-tests and src/tests/system-tests folders. They are optionally built with the ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING=ON (unit testing QA code), ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING_EXTRA=ON (unit tests that require extra files downloaded at configure time), ENABLE_SYSTEM_TESTING=ON (system tests, such as measurement of Time-To-First-Fix) and ENABLE_SYSTEM_TESTING_EXTRA=ON (extra system test requiring external tools, automatically downloaded and built at building time) configuration flags. The EXTRA options also download and build a custom software-defined signal generator and version 2.9 of GPSTk, if not already found on the system. Download and local link of version 2.9 can be forced by ENABLE_OWN_GPSTK=ON building configuration flag. Only ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING is set to ON by default.
- Unit tests added: CPU_multicorrelator_test and GPU_multicorrelator_test measure computer performance in multicorrelator setups.
- Unit tests added: GpsL1CADllPllTracking and GpsL1CATelemetryDecoderTest.
- System test added: ttff_gps_l1 performs a set of cold / assisted runs of the software receiver and computes statistics about the obtained Time To First Fix.
- System test added: obs_gps_l1_system_test uses an external software-defined signal generator to produce raw digital GNSS signal from a RINEX navigation file and a position (static or dynamic), processes it with GNSS-SDR, and then compares the RINEX observation file produced by the software receiver to that produced by the signal generator.
- Software Development Kit provided for embedded devices (see https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/tutorials/cross-compiling/).

### Improvements in Usability:

- Now the block factory automatically detects Channel input data type, so it is no longer required to specify Channel.input_type in the configuration. An error raises if Acquisition and Tracking Blocks are not configured with the same input data type.
- Block names changed from L2_M to L2C.
- Documentation available at https://gnss-sdr.org/docs/
- Improved tools for compilation, execution and testing in embedded devices.

## [0.0.7](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr/releases/tag/v0.0.7)

DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.51521

This release has several improvements, addition of new features and bug fixes:

- Improvements in receiver design: Internal block communication has been redesigned to accommodate the addition of new signals, and now upstream and downstream communication within blocks is implemented through the GNU Radio block’s asynchronous message passing system, leading to a more scalable, more robust and cleaner design.
- Improvements in receiver design: Correlators have been rewritten to take full advantage of VOLK and VOLK_GNSSSDR, and they are of general use for any tracking block. Their API now admit an arbitrary number of correlators, spaced in an arbitrary manner, in 16ic and 32fc versions.
- Improvements in receiver design: Block adapters are now all managed by smart pointers, ensuring better memory management.
- Improvements in processing speed: The VOLK_GNSSSDR library has been rewritten, following current VOLK standards and adding a number of new kernels.  This approach addresses both efficiency and portability. Now the library provides the key kernels for GNSS signal processing in 16ic and 32fc versions, including SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AV2 and NEON implementations. Please execute volk_gnsssdr_profile and volk_profile to use the fastest implementation for your host machine.
- New source block: Two_Bit_Packed_File_Signal_Source.  This block takes 2 bit samples that have been packed into bytes or shorts as input and generates a byte for each sample.
- Fixes in SUPL assistance (supl.nokia.com removed).
- Improvements in acquisition: Added a non CFAR PCPS acquisition algorithm based on the estimation of the post correlation noise floor. If enabled as an option in the acquisition configuration, it allows setting more stable thresholds in the presence of non-gaussian front-end noise (which is the usual behavior of front-ends.)
- Fixes in acquisition: Fixed mismatch between the config files and the acquisition code in the specification of the IF. Fixed a bug in the length of the FFT of local codes.
- Improvements in tracking sensitivity: Added configuration option to customize the extension of the GPS L1 CA correlation length after bit synchronization (options are: [1,2,4,5,10,20] ms). Only available in the GPS_L1_CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking implementation.
- New tracking block introduced: GPS_L1_CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking is a GPS L1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL with optional carrier-aid feedback. It is available in both 32 bits gr_complex input samples and in 16 bits short int complex samples. The gr_complex version has also the capability to extend the coherent correlation period from 1ms to 20ms using telemetry symbol synchronization.
- Increased resolution in CN0 estimator internal variables.
- Fixed a bug in computation of GPS L1 C/A carrier phase observable.
- Fixed a bug in the internal state machine that was blocking the receiver after a few hours of usage. Now the receiver can work continually (tested for more than one week, no known limit).
- New tracking block introduced: GPS_L1_CA_DLL_PLL_Tracking_GPU is a GPS L1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL that uses the CUDA-compatible GPU to compute carrier wipe off and correlation operations, alleviating the CPU load.
- Obsolete/buggy blocks removed: GPS_L1_CA_DLL_FLL_PLL_Tracking, GPS_L1_CA_DLL_PLL_Optim_Tracking.
- Added a RTCM printer and TCP server in PVT blocks (still experimental). The receiver is now able to stream data in real time, serving RTCM 3.2 messages to multiple clients. For instance, it can act as a Ntrip Source feeding a Ntrip Server, or to be used as data input in RTKLIB, obtaining Precise Point Positioning fixes in real-time. The TCP port, Station ID, and rate of MT1019/MT1045 and MSM can be configured. GPS_L1_CA_PVT serves MT1019 (GPS Ephemeris) and MSM7 (MT1077, full GPS pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution) messages, while GALILEO_E1_PVT serves MT1045 (Galileo ephemeris) and MSM7 (MT1097, full Galileo pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution).
- Added a GeoJSON printer. Basic (least-squares) position fixes can be now also stored in this format, in addition to KML.
- Obsolete block removed: output filter.
- QA code migrated to the new asynchronous message passing system.
- Improvements in documentation: update of README.md file, addition of documentation for the VOLK_GNSSSDR library, updated links to new ICDs.
- Improvements in documentation: Satellite identification updated to current constellation status.
- Updated and cleaner console output. Now Galileo satellites have the ‘E’ identifier in their PRN number.
- Several improvements in CMake scripts allow to build GNSS-SDR in Linux Debian (Jessie, Stretch and Sid), Ubuntu (from 12.04 to 16.04), including amd64, i386, armhf and arm64 architectures, and possibly in other GNU/Linux distributions, as well as in Mac OS X 10.9 to 10.11. It also works well with CMake 3.5 (some problems solved with VOLK_GNSSSDR as a sub-project).
- The software can link either against OpenSSL or against GnuTLS with openssl extensions, whatever it is available. This allows buildings in distributions such as Fedora or ArchLinux, while being compatible with binary distribution through Debian packages.
- Fixed a number of defects detected by Coverity Scan.
- Some fixes required by Debian licensing and packaging system.
- Added a CGRAN (http://www.cgran.org/) manifest
- Lots of code cleaning and fixes of typos and small bugs.
