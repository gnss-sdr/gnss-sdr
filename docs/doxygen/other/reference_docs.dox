The 'RTCA MOPS DO229D - appendix A' is the reference standard for WAAS/EGNOS application development. RTCA is an advisory committee of the US federal government, and issues standards for civil airborne equipment, among other duties. One such standard is MOPS 229D (Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Global Positioning System/Wide Area Augmentation System Airborne Equipment version D), which describes the implementation of satellite-based augmentation services (SBAS) for receivers designed for civil aviation use. An annex to DO229D contains the specifications for the SBAS signal and message. The RTCA provides regular updates to these standards. MOPS 229D is available for a fee from the <a href="https://my.rtca.org/nc__store?search=229D" target="_blank">RTCA website</a>.

\subsection rinex RINEX
The final output of a navigation receiver is usually its position, speed or other related physical quantities. However, the calculation of those quantities
are based on a series of measurements from one or more satellite constellations. Although receivers calculate positions in real time, in many cases it is
interesting to store intermediate measures for later post-processing. RINEX is the standard format that allows the management and disposal of the measures
generated by a receiver, as well as their off-line processing by a multitude of applications.

\li The most common version at present is <a href="hftp://igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex212.txt" target="_blank"><b>RINEX: The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 2.12</b></a>, which enables storage of measurements from pseudorange, carrier-phase and Doppler systems for GPS, GLONASS, Galileo
along with data from EGNOS and WAAS satellite based augmentation systems (SBAS).

\li The most recent version is <a href="ftp://igs.org/pub/data/format/rinex303.pdf" target="_blank"><b>RINEX: The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 3.03</b></a> published in July, 2015.
It includes Galileo and improves the handling of multi-constellation data files.

\subsection protocols Positioning protocols in wireless communication networks
Cellular industry location standards first appeared in the late 1990s, with the <a href="https://www.3gpp.org/index.php" target="_blank">3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)</a> radio resource location services protocol (RRLP) technical specification 44.031 positioning protocol for GSM networks.
Today, RRLP is the de facto standardized protocol to carry GNSS assistance data to GNSS-enabled mobile devices, and the term "3GPP specification" now covers all GSM (including GPRS and EDGE),
W-CDMA and LTE (including LTE-A) specifications. Precisely, the label "LTE-A" is applied to networks compliant with LTE Release 10 and beyond, which fulfill the requirements issued by
the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/Pages/default.aspx target="_blank">International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R)</a> in the global standard for international mobile telecommunications (IMT Advanced, also referred to as 4G)
access technologies.

\li LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP): <a href="https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/36355.htm" target="_blank"><b>3GPP Technical Specification 36.355</b></a>.

LTE Release 9 introduced extension hooks in LPP messages, so that the bodies external to 3GPP could extend the LPP feature set. OMA LPP extensions (LPPe), supported in SUPL 3.0, build on top of the 3GPP LPP reusing its procedures and data types.
Check the <a href="http://openmobilealliance.org/wp/index.html" target="_blank">OMA Specifications webpage</a> for updated information about LPP Extensions (LPPe) Specification.

\li The <a href="http://member.openmobilealliance.org/ftp/Public_documents/loc/Permanent_documents/OMA-TS-MLP-V3_5-20181119-D.zip" target="_blank"><b>OMA Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) V3.5</b></a> is an application-level protocol for getting the position of mobile stations (mobile phones, wireless personal digital assistants, etc.) independent
of underlying network technology. The MLP serves as the interface between a Location Server and a Location Services (LCS) Client.
This specification defines the core set of operations that a Location Server should be able to perform.
