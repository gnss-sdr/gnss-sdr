 * This header file contains the interface to an abstract class
 * for acquisition algorithms. Since all its methods are virtual,
 * this class cannot be instantiated directly, and a subclass can only be
 * instantiated directly if all inherited pure virtual methods have been
 * implemented by that class or a parent class.
