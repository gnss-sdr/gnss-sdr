 * \brief This class reads an INI file into easy-to-access name/value pairs.
 * \author Brush Technologies, 2009.
 *
 * inih (INI Not Invented Here) is a simple .INI file parser written in C++.
 * It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was designed to be small
 * and simple, so it's good for embedded systems. To use it, just give
 * ini_parse() an INI file, and it will call a callback for every
 * name=value pair parsed, giving you strings for the section, name,
 * and value. It's done this way because it works well on low-memory
 * embedded systems, but also because it makes for a KISS implementation.
